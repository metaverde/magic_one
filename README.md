First attempt at sigilization automation

I am actively engaged in tech through magic, so many of my programs will have magical implications.
This is formatted as a prayer to the entity of your choice
with an unprinted time frame
and the opportunity to input several outcomes.

It was a stroke of brilliance, really.

Now I'm working on converting it to JavaScript so that I can put it in a drop-down on my web-page.

Ultimately it will be an interactive with tokens 
blockchain writing
program.

The work is done,
then forgotten.
In this way it lasts forever.

Bless up,
Petra Machemathe.
